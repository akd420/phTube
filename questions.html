      <h3 class="font-semibold">
        Question 1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-3">
        <span class="font-semibold">ANS: </span>The scope of a var variable is
        functional scope or a global scope depending on where the variable is
        declared. The scope of a let variable and const variable is block scope.
        Global scope means the scope from where everyone can get access to
        datas. Variable declared on global scope can be accessible form anywhere
        in the program. Functional scope means here variable can be accessed
        only in that specific function. Similarly in a block function variable
        can be only accessed inside that block scope.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold">
        Question 2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <span class="font-semibold">ANS: </span>Null and undefined represents
        the absence of a value. Null is used to represent the intentional
        absence of a value, while undefined is used to represent the
        unintentional absence of a value. When there is a variable declared but
        its value is not assigned then we get undefined. And when there is a
        variable declared but its value is assigned "null" then we get null. The
        variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-semibold">Question 3: What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <span class="font-semibold">ANS: </span>REST API stands for
        Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is
        an architectural style for designing APIs that are based on HTTP. REST
        APIs are used to expose data and functionality of a server to other
        applications. It is a way for two applications to communicate with
        each other using HTTP requests and responses.
